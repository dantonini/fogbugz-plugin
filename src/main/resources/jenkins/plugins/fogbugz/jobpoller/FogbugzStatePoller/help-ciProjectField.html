<div>
    This is the name of the field in which the CI-project the case should be merged into is specified. This is the lowercase name of the field, with all non-alphabetical characters replaced by 'x'. 
    For example, if your field is called 'CI Project', you would fill in 'cixproject'. If it is 'Project 123*', you'd fill in 'projectxxxxx'. Please ensure that there are no custom fields in jenkins 
    whose names would be the same with this replacement (e.g. make sure you don't have 'project name 1' and project name 2', as they'd both be 'projectxnamexx').
